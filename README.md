# pycprops
Python implementation of the CPROPS algorithm from [Rosolowsky & Leroy (2006)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006PASP..118..590R/abstract).

This implements the same approaches developed in that paper, but there are a few changes in the shift to python:

- Local maximum identification and decimation uses the `astrodendro` dendrogram generation package, which is much faster than the approach used in the original IDL version. 
- The assignment of pixels to clouds uses the `scikit-image` segmentation toolkit, which leads to different (better) pixel assignment around a local maxium.  The boundaries between clouds are more "natural" than they were in the original `cprops` code.
- Property extrapolation uses actual robust regression leading to <10% differences in some properties.

# Installation

`pycprops` is an installable python package.  Clone or download the github repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/PhangsTeam/pycprops.git
cd pycprops
python setup.py install
```

After installation, you can run in python:

```
import pycprops
import astropy.units as u
cubefile = 'mycube.fits'  # Your cube
mask = 'mycube.mask.fits' # Mask defining where to find emission
d = 8.0 * u.kpc           # Distance (with units)

pycprops.fits2props(cubefile,
                    mask_file=mask,
                    distance=d,               
                    asgnname='mycube.asgn.fits',
                    propsname='mycube.props.fits')
```

The results of the `pycprops` code is an assignment file (`mycube.asgn.fits`) and a FITS BINTABLE (`mycube.props.fits`) catalog of GMC properties.  The tags in that catalog are described in the table below.
